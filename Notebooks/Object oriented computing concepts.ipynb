    "In programming, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating instances (objects) that share similar attributes and behaviors. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single unit, allowing objects to be created based on its specifications."
